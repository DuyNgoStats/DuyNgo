# Workshop overview 

In recent years, the use of Bayesian methodologies is on the rise in many research domains. The Bayesian data analysis represents a powerful tool for interpretation of study results, evaluation of hypotheses compared with the practice of p-values, and estimating models that are too complex or too computationally demanding for the frequentist approach, such as high-dimensional data, multiple endpoints and spatial correlation. 


The Bayesian Statistics Training workshop is offering a two-day comprehensive workshop of lectures and hands-on analytical sessions to introduce the ideas of Bayesian inference and modeling. The workshop is tailored for students and researchers who have no familiarity with Bayesian analysis and would like to apply Bayesian statistics in their research.
