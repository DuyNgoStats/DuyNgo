Biography
====================================================================================

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Western Michigan University. My research interests include Bayesian analysis, clustering, time series, spectral analysis, and functional data analysis. I am also working on statistical modeling and machine learning for subgroup identification/analysis for benefit--risk assessment. Before coming to Western Michigan University, I received my Ph.D. (2018) in statistics from the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu/). Then I joined Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway, New Jersey as a postdoctoral fellow.
