Biography
====================================================================================

I am currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at Western Michigan University. Before coming to Western Michigan University, I received my Ph.D. (2018) in statistics from the [University of California, Irvine](https://www.stat.uci.edu/), and I started as a postdoctoral fellow at Merck Research Laboratory in Rahway, New Jersey.  My research interests include Bayesian analysis, time series, spectral analysis, benefit–risk assessment for medicines and casual inference. I am also working on statistical modeling and machine learning for complex genome-wide epigenetic data.
